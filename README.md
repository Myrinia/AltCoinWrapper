# **AltCoinWrapper**

AltCoinWrapper provides a simple to use GUI for diffrent Cryptocoin Miners out there..

# **What it does in Detail**

*All requests are made using the API of the provided Miners*

 **Startup**:
	* On Startup it launches ccMiner to query for CUDA devices
	* If it finds cuda Devices, it will set to correct values into the GUI, this is needed to query WhattoMine.com
	
 **Start Button pressed**
	* Query Whattomine.com with the Data from your GUI ( Hardware Specific Request ! )
	* The Data returned is a JSON. The JSON is used to get the most profitable coin to Mine
	* If an Algo is found, which is a Pool set for in the Config + a Wallet Adress is set in the config
	* The Miner will start Mining

# F.A.Q.	
* Does it contain Fees / Virus / Keyloggers or anything which is not stated above.
** No.

* Why is it written in Java.
** Straight forward development, to finish the project fast, there is no need for the Wrapper to be fast, the work is done by the Miner executables itself
** Easy to decompile, for those who want to have a look into the source / don't believe that there are no fees, or hidden actions performed ....

* Supported OS
** Windows 7,8,8.1,10 - Yes
** Unix - Not Testst, for Sure the Executables in MinerBinarys/ needs to get exchange, then it might work.

* Why don't you release the Source Code
** I don't want to have "Fake" Wrappers released that contain harmful software, thats not what this project is about.
